##  2. <a name='Coursedescription'></a>Course description and grading :dart:

In this course, there are three modules:
- Part I:  Statistical Inference
- Part II:  Anova analysis and design of experiments
- Part III: Deep Learning
The Part I and II will have stronger focus on the theory and the Part III focus on the applications.

This course is continuously evaluated and have following two grading items :dart:
- Three Lab quizs (30\%): pass/fail . Each passing lab accounts for 10 % of the final grade.
  
- Final project: 70 % of the final grade, consisting of three milestones
  * Midterm presentation on the project proposal and progress (April 15): feedback will be given but not graded
  * Final presentation on the project (May 27): graded
  * Final project report (due on May 27): graded


##  3. <a name='Online materials'></a>Online materials

This course will follow the online course materials shared by the statistics department, the Penn State University. 
Specifically, we will follow the following three courses and part of their their lessons. 
Here are the online for this course.
- [STAT4215 (lessons 2-14 )](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/)
- [STAT503 (lessons 3.5-7 )](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/)
- [STAT510: (lessons 1-5)](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/)

The recommended book for CS4215 and we will use exercises of this book in the book.

##  4. <a name='Courseteam'></a>Course team

This course will be mainly taught by [Prof. Lydia Y Chen](https://lydiaychen.github.io/)  The course team is composed of a number of PhDs  who support the course through guest lectures and project supervision and a TA who focuses on the grading of homework.
